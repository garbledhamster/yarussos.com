# The Story of Yarusso Brothers Restaurant

## Francesco Yarusso: A Journey from Italy to St. Paul

Francesco Yarusso, the founder of Yarusso Brothers Restaurant, was born in a small village approximately 140 miles south of Rome. In 1899, at the age of 18, he arrived in the United States with his sister, Amelia. They settled in Newark, NJ, where Francesco met and married Dora Corbo in 1901. 

In 1904, Francesco and Dora moved to St. Paul, Minnesota. Their first home was located in Swede Hollow. The couple had 14 children. Around 1911, they moved up the hill to Decatur Street, now known as lower Payne Avenue. Francesco worked various jobs, including at a foundry, Northern State Power, and Schmidt Brewery.

## The Birth of a Tradition

In 1932, Francesco opened his own tavern. Due to Prohibition, he initially sold only near-beer. The following year, he expanded by opening the **"Square Deal Café."** Every family member worked in the café at some point. The Italian sport of Bocce Ball quickly became a popular event at the café. Francesco installed the first Bocce alleys in St. Paul, which are still in use today. Many patrons recall their fathers and grandfathers gathering on Sundays to smoke cigars and argue over a game of Bocce.

## Passing the Torch: The Yarusso Brothers

In 1947, Francesco retired, and his sons—Joseph, Ernest, and David—took over the restaurant, renaming it **"Yarusso Bros."** Their sister, Margaret, and brother, Lawrence, provided dedicated assistance. Each sibling brought their own sense of humor and personality, creating a unique atmosphere in the restaurant.

Other family members contributed to the lively environment. The home-cooked food has remained much the same for over 60 years, including the sauce recipe created by Francesco.

## A Third-Generation Legacy

David's home was located just five feet from the restaurant, and his three sons—David, Frederick, and Michael—began working there as youngsters. They often refer to the restaurant as their second home. Today, they proudly carry on the tradition as third-generation Italians.

## A Testament to Tradition

While the world has changed dramatically since the 1930s, **Yarusso Brothers Restaurant** has remained much as it was when it first opened, serving as a testimony to Francesco's legacy. David, Fred, and Michael Yarusso continue to honor their father and grandfather by maintaining the restaurant's traditions.

The Yarusso Brothers express deep gratitude to their loyal customers, some of whom represent the fifth generation of patrons. These customers play a big role in keeping the Yarusso legacy alive.

## A Heartfelt Thanks

The Yarusso Brothers want to thank their patrons, who return again and again, declaring:

> "The reason Yarusso's is so special is because of the customers who have helped keep our family legacy alive. Thank you!"
